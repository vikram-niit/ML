# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Projects

This repository is a curated collection of **machine learning (ML)** projects developed for learning, experimentation, and showcasing applied ML skills.  
Each project demonstrates a key concept, workflow, or algorithm â€” from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment.
